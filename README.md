## 🎮 The Problem  
CAPTCHAs are annoying.  
No one wants to click blurry buses or decipher squiggly letters anymore.  
We wanted to make human verification actually fun — so we gamified it.

---

## 👾 What We Built  
**RetroCAPTCHA** replaces traditional CAPTCHAs with **playable retro mini-games**, starting with a custom-built **Space Shooter**.  
To pass the CAPTCHA, you just need to survive. Dodge, shoot, score — boom, you’re verified.

To make things extra spicy, we trained a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to play the game like a bot — and tuned the game so only humans can reliably pass.  
Also, it's not just browser-based — we made it **MetaQuest-compatible**, because why not flex in VR while verifying you're human?

## 🧠 How It Works  
- 🕹️ **Custom JS Space Shooter game** (Canvas API)  
- 🌐 **Node.js/Express backend** handles user game data + logic  
- 🧠 **DQN bot in TensorFlow** trained to simulate bot behavior  
- 🎯 Difficulty and thresholds based on human vs bot performance  
- 🥽 Fully compatible with **MetaQuest VR**, powered by WebXR  

---

## 🔥 Features  
- ✅ Fun, fast-paced CAPTCHA gameplay  
- 🤖 Trained AI bot to test and tune difficulty  
- 🧩 Modular design – add more games easily  
- 🕶️ VR support with MetaQuest compatibility  
- 🔌 Embeddable in websites, login forms, and more  
- 👾 First of many: **More retro games coming soon**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS (WebXR for VR support)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **ML Model:** Python, TensorFlow (Deep Q-Learning)  
- **VR:** WebXR + MetaQuest support  
- **Game Engine:** Custom-built Canvas logic (no frameworks)

---

## 🌌 Game #1: Space Shooter  
- Control a spaceship in a galactic battlefield  
- Destroy enemies, dodge obstacles, and survive for 30 seconds  
- Keyboard and VR controller support  
- Human-passable, bot-breakable

🎯 **More games coming soon:**  
- 🐍 Snake  
- 🧱 Brick Breaker  
- 🏓 Pong  
- And more...
