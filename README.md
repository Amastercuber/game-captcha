## 🎮 The Problem  
Let’s face it — old CAPTCHAs are annoying. Clicking fire hydrants and typing blurry letters? Nah.  
We wanted to **make human verification actually fun** — so we brought back classic retro games and turned them into CAPTCHAs.

## 👾 What We Built  
**RetroCAPTCHA** replaces boring verification with a playable **Space Shooter** game.  
You dodge meteors, shoot enemies, and survive — all in under 30 seconds.  
If you win, you're verified. If you're a bot? Good luck, buddy.

But here’s the twist:  
We trained a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to play the same game like a bot. That way, we could design the experience to keep it secure — and still human-friendly.

## 🧠 How It Works  
- **JavaScript** frontend with a retro-style Space Shooter  
- **Node.js backend** validates performance (score, actions, etc.)  
- **TensorFlow-based DQN** trained on simulated gameplay  
- Dynamic thresholds so bots fail and humans pass  
- Built with modularity: you can plug in new games later!

## 🔥 Features  
- 🎮 Space Shooter mini-game CAPTCHA  
- 🤖 AI-trained bot to simulate attacks  
- 🔐 Anti-bot logic without killing user experience  
- 📦 Easy to plug into any web app  
- 🧩 Scalable system for new game-based CAPTCHAs

## 🧪 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **ML Model:** Python, TensorFlow (DQN)  
- **Game Engine:** Custom JS Canvas

## 🌍 Our First Game: Space Shooter  
- Control a spaceship and survive for 30 seconds  
- Real-time score tracking and dynamic enemies  
- Keyboard-based controls (Arrow keys + Spacebar)  
- Tuned to give humans a fun edge, while bots struggle
